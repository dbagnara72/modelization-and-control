1 - given L, Iavg, Ipk Irms, switching frequency;
2 - select ferrite material, often according to given switching frequency and power losses;
3 - set Bpk based on hysteresis curve;
4 - set delta-B based on desired core losses;
5 - assume J (1-4.5A/mm2), kf (0.3-0.7);
6 - calculate different Ap methods and select the largest;
7 - from Irms, and J calculate wire diameter;
8 - calculate number of turns;
9 - estimate gap length;
10 - adjust gap;
11 - calculate losses: core, wire (resistance, proximity);
12 - iterate;


e.g. material matching finding 100mW/cm3 at given frequency; if we need larger Aw we could work with
much lower delta-B which permits also to increase the switching frequency.

Example:
Iavg = 45A
L = 25uH
delta-I = 44A
Ipk = Iavg + 0.5*delta-I = 67A
f = 300kHz
Pcore = 100mW/cm3
Core = 3C94
Core Shape = E 
Bpk_max = 300mWb/m2
kf = 0.5
J = 4.5A/mm2
Irms = sqrt(45^2+22^2)= 50A
Bpk = 40mT - selected value
Ap2 = 1.9 10^5 mm^4 > Ap1 = 1.16 10^5 mm^4
Ap of the coil former must be greater than Ap2;
